## ⚙️ AI in Action – What Powers Muthmir

### 1. 🌱 Plant Disease Detection
A deep learning model analyzes leaf images to identify diseases early, minimizing crop damage and boosting plant health.

### 2. 🌿 Plant Growth Stage Classification
A custom AI model classifies plant development stages to optimize irrigation, lighting, and nutrients.

### 3. AI-Powered Chatbot
- 🔍 **Search**: Retrieves agricultural info from online sources.
- 💡 **Control**: Operates greenhouse components like fans, lights, and irrigation.
- 📊 **Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis on greenhouse data.
- ❓ **Retrieve**: Answers user questions about the system, features, and goals.

> 🔒 *Domain-restricted: The chatbot only responds to agriculture-related queries.*

### 4. ⚡ Electricity Consumption Forecasting
Predicts future electricity usage using historical data and device activity trends.

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization

We leveraged **Power BI** to build a real-time dashboard that visualizes:
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Air Humidity
- 🌱 Soil Moisture

Users can select custom time ranges and interact with live visualizations to track environmental changes over the past 24 hours.
